# Product Replacement Verification

Verified at `2026-05-08 14:21:35 KST`.

## Scope

Objective: replace and verify the Creator "my updates with new replies" product
use-site in `CS2ZhrORl4E1szQfTe2UvO` using the new CDS `Lounge Update Item`
component.

The replacement scope is the Creator Case `Creator Lounge Updates Screen`
(`24112:14112`) that originated from the existing `Lounge Card` node
`25945:38066` and proposal source node `28047:38198`.

## Screenshots

- Replaced instance `28428:29052`: `https://www.figma.com/api/mcp/asset/c4ab3818-1bf7-42a6-a06f-48c9e9d1a13f`
- Creator screen `24112:14112`: `https://www.figma.com/api/mcp/asset/686c5b95-53dd-4160-b999-765b20afaeb6`

## Out Of Scope

`Consumer Use Case > Creator Lounge Updates Screen` still has a manual
Lounge-update-like frame (`28040:37949`) with a reaction bar and feed footer.
That screen is not the "my updates / new replies" Creator Case use-site from
this request. Treat it as a separate cleanup candidate if the same component
should be rolled out beyond the requested use-site.
